# Autism-Detection

Autism detection refers to the process of identifying individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) through various diagnostic methods. It involves evaluating behavioral patterns, developmental milestones, and communication skills. Modern approaches incorporate machine learning and AI models trained on data such as facial expressions, speech patterns, or genetic markers to enhance early and accurate detection. Early diagnosis is crucial for implementing tailored therapies, improving social interaction, and supporting developmental progress.
